My brother, on the other hand, was a GENIUS/NINJA at the art of peaking behind the wrapping paper. To this day, my parents have no idea just HOW good he really was. If he wanted something from me, he could easily convince me to do something under the threat of telling me what it was. As I got older, I started to become a lot more curious about what gifts he "supposedly stumbled on". He would throw out hints here and there and they would never be helpful.

I love surprises. I enjoy being surprised. I don't like to open gifts before the designated time and I certainly don't like to know what the presents are before I open them. My brother, on the other hand, was a GENIUS/NINJA at the art of peaking behind the wrapping paper. To this day, my parents have no idea just HOW good he really was. If he wanted something from me, he could easily convince me to do something under the threat of telling me what it was. As I got older, I started to become a lot more curious about what gifts he "supposedly stumbled on". He would throw out hints here and there and they would never be helpful. 

One year, he stumbled on something that he knew that I would love. For weeks, he would hype it up and it drove me crazy. To be honest, it didn't seem likely that whatever he saw could be THAT good. I think I was 12 so unless my parents had decided to buy me a car and tell me that I could drive it without a license, I couldn't imagine what could possibly be THAT good. 

To be honest, I don't remember what the gift was. I remember being excited. I remember getting a Nintendo 64 for my birthday that year. Maybe we got the game we had been wanting and that extra controller that we so desperately "needed". All I remember is that my brother had seen the gifts and he couldn't wait until I opened them. In fact, he was more excited about my gifts than he was his own.

My son and I were driving around shopping for gifts the other day. Out of the blue he saked me "why do some people not believe in Jesus". If you know anything about Joel, you know that we don't have "normal" conversations. This particular question made me think, though, as he followed it up with: "Does God love them too? Is He mad at them? Does He forgive them?" I sat quiet for a minute. I think he's used to that by now when he knows that he's asked a really good one. I paused and then gave him an analogy. And by that I mean I'm like 99% Holy Spirit gave me a vision that I spoke from because I had NOTHING.

<blockquote>Imagine a Christmas Tree, buddy. Underneath that tree is a bunch of presents. One of them is full of forgiveness, another is full of righteousness, and the gifts don't seem to end. God has already paid for each of them and they're waiting for everyone but not everyone makes the choice to open them. When they come to Jesus and surrender their life, they get to come into the house of God and they're given salvation. But some people are too afraid to walk through the door. </blockquote>

"But why, dad?" he asked in frustration. "That doesn't make any sense!". "I know, buddy", I said. "It really doesn't." Then I started to think about it some more. If it's so simple, why do some choose not to open the door?

<blockquote>What if I told you that we've overcomplicated the gospel so much that we're not excited for people to understand it because we don't even understand it ourselves?</blockquote>

We've seen the gifts the Father has waiting for everyone: salvation, forgiveness, holiness, love, acceptance, and more! We literally cannot EVER hype these up enough. We can never speak more greatly of God than He already is. We can never make God out to be any more GOOD than He already is. We can never make God out to be anymore POWERFUL than He already is. We can never overexaggerate His love.

<blockquote>"The gospel is not an invitation to accept Jesus; it is the stunning announcement that He accepts you" - Paul Ellis</blockquote>

What if people don't open the door because we've misrepresented the Father that's waiting for them? What if we've overcomplicated the instructions for opening the door? What if it's really as simple as pointing them to the truth and them choosing to turn the knob?

I speak from experience. I overcomplicated this thing for years. I thought you had to get someone to repeat your prayer verbatim. I thought I had to wear them down so that they would eventually give up and just say "fine! I'll say what you want me to say". The reality is that if I remember there's a house full of gifts waiting for them...if I remember that I can never overexaggerate just HOW GOOD my Father really is...everything gets so much simpler. When I keep that in the forefront of my mind, I become like my brother. I'm not focused on my own gifts. I'm focused on how excited I am about yours and when you see how excited I am, you'll start to get excited too. And I promise. Oh, I promise. When people hear the simple gospel...when they hear TRUTH spoken over them, something inside of them awakens. I think we've gotten so concerned with the soil that we're planting in that we've forgotten to make sure we're even sending the right seed. Become love, speak truth, and watch God water what you sow!

Christmas is incredible. We get to celebrate the birth of our King that laid down His crown so that you and I can pick up ours. We are ambassadors of hope. We carry the Kingdom and we're called to make the world around look like the Heaven that's inside of us. We've been set free from our old selves so that we can step into a new life of royalty. That's the simple gospel! When we're bold enough to release the hope inside of us and speak truth to replace lies, we see others get set free. We have been given the greatest gift of ALL! Let's BE a gift to all!

I want to encourage you today. The confidence that you've been searching for is found in a knowledge of all that Jesus has done for you. The affirmation you've been looking for is found in the acceptance that you've already found in Him. Be fully present this Christmas and be a gift to those around you.
