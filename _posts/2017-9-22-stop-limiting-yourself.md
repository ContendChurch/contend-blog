Have you ever been disoriented in the middle of the day? You begin to wonder...how long have I been sitting? How long have I been starting at this same paragraph? Why was I reading Facebook comments for 30 minutes? Where has my day gone?! Then you move into the "I'm awake now" phase. You feel like you've just woken up and you don't really know how you "fell asleep" to begin with. 

For almost thirty years of my life, I was asleep. When I snapped out of it, I had the same questions: why did I live this way for so long? Why didn't I see the truth right in front of me? How could I have missed all of this? Where have I been? 

<blockquote>I was stuck under the power of the lie that said: "people and the environment around me ultimately shaped who I would become."</blockquote>

I was striving to perform my way into popularity, acceptance, and love. When someone would reject me, I would be offended. I pushed for promotions and would be rejected and offended. When that became a pattern, I would eventually make an excuse for not trying anymore. 

<blockquote>I let the opinions of people define my value.</blockquote>

Simply put: excuses are strongholds that limit potential. When you allow an offense to take root, it bears the fruit of excuses that we partner with to explain why we don't see what God has promised. 

You might be thinking <em>"but you don't know what they did to me..."</em>

<h3>It's not about what they did TO you; it's about what He did FOR you.</h3>

Your value never changes. There is no depreciation in the Kingdom. Your life was paid for with the highest price. Your value is in the DNA that was infused into your very being when you were born again. We will strive our entire life until we learn to live in the rest (peace) that He died to give us.

You might be thinking <em>"but you don't know where I came from..."</em>

<h3>It doesn't matter where you came from; what matters is where you live now.</h3>

The Spirit is life, liberty, joy, and peace. When you said yes to Jesus, your body became a temple of the Holy Spirit. He washed you clean and you were reborn. Why? BECAUSE YOU DIED. I'm convinced that we get stuck in the past because we don't embrace the simple truth that it's no longer us that live but Christ IN US, the hope of Glory. You are seated in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus. Your last home might have been horrible you're not called to look from earth to Heaven. You're called to look from Heaven to earth! WE need to learn to live in our present (new self) rather than from our past (old self).

Paul says in Romans 8: 38-39:

<blockquote>For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</blockquote>

Do you know what's NOT in that list? Your past. It's not there because it's the only thing that you can empower to block you from living in the fullness of His love for you. Are you still loved when you live in the past? OF COURSE! BEING loved and KNOWING that you're loved are two totally different things. When you don't know that you're loved, you begin to doubt the promises of God and breathe life into the excuses that preventing you from reaching your potential.

I want to encourage you today that no matter what side of the bed you woke up on, His grace is sufficient to break off the lies you've been embracing. You're not like everyone else. You're not insignficant. You DO have value. You CAN be effective. You ARE loved. You ARE a conqueror. You ARE uniquely gifted. 

Stop limiting yourself!
