<blockquote>People need to see what it looks like for LOVE to take over the streets of Austin</blockquote>

Tomorrow night, January 5th, we are going to saturate 7 cross-street corners in Austin along 6th street from 9-10:30pm. (Congress to Sabine). Churches from all over the Austin-Metro area are coming together to MARK their City and put His love on display. 

For more information on how to get involved or support through pray and intercession, <a href="http://cornerup.contend.church">check out the event page</a>.
