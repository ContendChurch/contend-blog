title: You're Not A Carbon Copy

We've all had our bouts with comparison. We've thought highly of others and low of ourselves. Some of us have even prayed the prayers that sound like "God, can you just make me more like HIM/HER?! I promise I'd use those gifts for you!"  It seems so easy to do, doesn't it?

This morning I had this vivid visual of creation. I saw God blowing on the dust in His hands and forming Adam. I saw their relationship together and then I saw God fashioning Eve. Then I saw both scenes at once and I asked the question that we've all asked: "Why did God create them differently?"

And then I heard the Lord say: <em>because my creativity is expressed differently through each individual</em>.

I think God used the rib of Adam because it helps illustrate that we have things in common; but just because we have things in common doesn't mean we're supposed to look the same! God's creative expression isn't limited to what we've already seen Him do.

God places a unique piece of Himself in all of us. It's the reason why TOGETHER we get to look like Jesus! We all represent Him but we can never fully <em>re-present</em> Him by ourselves. We all add value to the masterpiece that He's created and our value was determined by the price He paid to bring us into right standing with Him. In other words: 

<blockquote>My created value doesn't look like yours but it's just as valuable.</blockquote>

When we lust after the gifts we see in others, we devalue the gifts that He has already placed in us. I want to encourage you today to embrace your value and to be found thankful. Listen to this song and ask God to show you more of what He's placed inside of you. I pray that He reveal to you a greater revelation of your value and a deeper understanding of the fact that you were destined to represent Him to this world.
