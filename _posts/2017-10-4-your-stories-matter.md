Have you ever found yourself wishing that you had a better story to tell? Maybe you indulge a little while you tell your friends about your "flat tire" this morning - when really you just needed to stop to put a little air. Or maybe you daydream about doing things and share them as if they really happened. Either way, I've been there. I wanted a better story. A more compelling story. Something that I thought was entertaining enough to keep someone's attention.

I grew up learning about the importance of "my testimony". In Sunday school, I learned that testimony was a fancy word for "story". I didn't understand what it meant but then I heard people giving examples of their testimony and it was always about how they "got saved". It was this "testimony" that we were supposed to use when we would witness to someone. Now, I LOVE a good story about how Jesus saved someone but I'm afraid we've really missed the point if we think a testimony is one time thing.

I never thought my testimony was good enough. I wanted to indulge because "growing up in church" just doesn't seem as compelling as "I used to be a drug addict and almost died". I thought that those people were forgiven of so much more so God would use them in much bigger ways than He would ever use me. I had blinders on and I didn't even know it!

In the beginning of the book of Acts, Jesus tells His disciples to wait for Holy Spirit to come upon them:

<blockquote>but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth. - Acts 1:8</blockquote>

Notice that Jesus tells them that they shall BE His witnesses <em>(noun)</em>; He doesn't tell them TO witness <em>(verb)</em>. But what REALLY got me today is that I realized He said that they shall BE His witnesses WHEN the Holy Spirit has come upon them. He used the word "witness" because they were eye-witnesses of all that He had done. 

<blockquote>This means that without the power of Holy Spirit, they couldn't become what they had seen Him do</blockquote>

In order to BE witnesses, we have to be an eye-witness of Jesus. You can't manufacture an encounter and expect it to transfer power. Only the testimony of Jesus has the power to transform but He shares that power through every encounter that we have with Him. We were never meant to write down one encounter with Jesus and use it to witness. We're meant to be in constant communion with Jesus so that everyday we have a new story (testimony) of what we've witnessed of His nature. 

Maybe you weren't a drug addict but God kept you from drugs. Maybe you didn't struggle with porn but God kept you pure. And God wants to do it again.

<blockquote>Every testimony we share is an invitation for others to see God do it again!</blockquote>

People can't become what they haven't seen. Jesus moved in the power of Holy Spirit and His resurrection power is alive inside of us. He wants to do more and is looking for vessels that are surrendered to Him and willing to become a witness for Him!

I want to encourage you today to write down something that God has done for you. I'm convinced that if we looked for God in more areas of our lives, we would see that He's moving in every area of our lives. You never know what the person standing in front of you today is going through. He's delivered us into freedom and He wants to do it again for them.
