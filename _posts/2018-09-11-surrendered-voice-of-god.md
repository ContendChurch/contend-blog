"I don’t want it if you're not in it.....I just want you", as I heard those lyrics coming out of the speakers of my car, I immediately felt my stomach drop.  That simple statement had just blown-up my personal definition of being fully surrendered to Jesus.  

From an honest assessment of my inner dialogue with the Holy Spirit, the question, "Are you in this situation?” was rarely asked. Usually, the questions asked were, "Does this bring glory to your name?” "Would this be good or productive for me?” ”Does this line up with what your word says?”  

Those are not necessarily the wrong questions to ask, but I began to really process and think about how the question, "are you in this” truly simplified the guidelines of a surrendered life.   

In Galatians 2:20 it says, "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.” For this to be a reality in our life we need to stay sensitive to the voice of God and continue to ask for direction with every decision we make.  

It is very easy to start to bypass that important process especially in situations where the choice you are going to make is not bad and, in all aspects, seems to be right. The key is did you bring the decision before Jesus or did you just assume it would be a good decision. 

Some may be thinking well how do you know you are hearing the voice of God and the answers to the questions you are asking. This is a topic I will be going to into more depth in a later a post in the meantime below is the main guideline I use every time I am talking to the Holy Spirit. This has helped me to grow in confidence to distinguish what is and is not the voice of God. 

<blockquote>You must become still and focus on Jesus and the peace you feel in the moment or a time of overwhelming peace you have felt in the past.</blockquote>

It’s from that place that I personally am able to hear His voice, and am able to commune and begin to submit my decisions before him. Because as the song I began this post with states, "I don’t want it if you're not in it.....I just want you.” 

Here is the song I mentioned:
