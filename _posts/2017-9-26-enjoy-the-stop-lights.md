While driving this morning God reminded me to enjoy the stoplights. I can choose to take the Toll road if I want. It will get me there quickly and without stopping. However, there is a cost. Sometimes God wants to move us to the next place by using the Toll road. He has cleared a path and needs us to get there quickly. 

For me, this is usually the way I want to travel most often. However, God reminded me to take the surface streets. When we are on the surface streets God gives us stoplights so we can pause and look around. We can take the time to see His goodness all around us. 

<blockquote>Sometimes there are things we need to see and appreciate.</blockquote>

Sometimes there are things we need to stop and pick up along the way to our next destination. If there are lessons to be learned in order to prepare us, we need the stoplights to give us that chance. If we were on the toll road, we wouldn't have that opportunity. God goes before us on both roads and clears the way in His timing. We can benefit from both but sometimes may feel anxious on the surface road thinking it is taking too much time to get where we want to go. 

God put us on that road for a reason, and He wants to show us good things and prepare us for the destination. We can't always do that on the Toll road. Jesus walked, He didn't run, He took His time and He wants us to do the same. He has good things ahead for us because He loves us and He wants us to appreciate the road trip as well as the destination. He has put those stoplights in strategically in place for our benefit. 

I want to encourage you today that God's goodness can be found everywhere. He wants to take His time and show you His goodness along the way. He loves you enough to make sure you are ready for the next destination.
