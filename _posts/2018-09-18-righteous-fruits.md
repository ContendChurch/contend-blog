<blockquote>What difference does it make?</blockquote>

I've had a lot of questions thrown my way but this one stunned me and marked me. I had a message in my spirit that I didn't have language for in the natural but I was trying SO HARD to communicate it anyway. I was starting to understand Romans 4:25:

<blockquote>He was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification. (Romans 4:25)</blockquote>

"Justified! Just-as-if we never sinned! We don't have a sinful nature anymore!" It was reveberating and burning like a fire within me. I shared what I knew in my spirit to be truth and then he asked that famous question. What difference does it make? For two years, I've saught to put language to WHY it matters. 

<blockquote>It matters because if we don't see that we're righteous in Him, we'll always strive to be attain something we already have.</blockquote>

Peter charges us in 1 Peter 1:16 to "be holy as I am holy" (referencing Leviticus). Paul echoes this in Ephesians 5 as he talks about the church being presented as holy without blemish. We can dive into a dozen more scriptures but we can summarize all of them by simply saying: we are called to BE holy. If you didn't catch the emphasis, we're called to BE holy; we're not called to just DO "holy things". What's the difference?

<blockquote>Holiness looks a lot like legalism to those who are trying to produce the fruit in their own strength</blockquote>

The Lord makes His word so simple for us but we turn it into something complicated enough to fight about. Let's take a quick look at a few scriptures:

<blockquote>He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. (2 Corinthians 5:21)</blockquote>

<blockquote>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:20-23)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit. (Matthew 12:33)</blockquote>

Now let's connect the dots:

<ul>
    <li>Jesus became sin so that we might become God's righteousness IN Christ. He clothes us in His robe of righteousness (Isaiah 61:10). </li>
    <li>Paul says that we had no fruit when we were slaves to sin but now that we slaves to righteousness, we have our fruit to holiness.</li>
    <li>Jesus made our tree good so now the fruit is good too.</li>
</ul>

Here's the revelation that I want you to pray into today: 

<blockquote>The byproduct of what we're believing is the fruit that we're living.</blockquote>

If you believe you're righteous and that He made your tree good, then you will naturally produce His Holy fruit (Galatians 5:22-23). You don't have to TRY to be more Holy. You have to BELIEVE that you ARE righteous by His GRACE. Grace isn't some twisted license to do whatever you want and get away with it. Grace is the operational power of God on your life to live FREE from ALL sin. He made you to look like Him. The more you believe that, the more you look like Him and your heart will gradually shift from the things that distract you. It's not legalism. It's LOVE. It always has and always will be about intimacy with Jesus:

<blockquote>"So you must remain in life-union with me, for I remain in life-union with you. For as a branch severed from the vine will not bear fruit, so your life will be fruitless unless you live your life intimately joined to mine." (John 15:4)</blockquote>

I want to encourage you today to press into this with Holy Spirit. Spend time asking the Lord to show you what it means to be clothed in His righteousness. Don't just borrow my revelation, ask Him to make it your own. Change your mind (repent) about how you've viewed yourself and begin to come into agreement with TRUTH. Stop trying to produce the fruit that only Holy Spirit can produce. We're not supposed to get tired by living out the gospel. It's the source of life, not a drain on our life! We only get tired when we pursue answers and change outside of intimacy with Him. Intimacy with Him is the source of life. Don't make the mistake of letting anything matter more than what matters most.
