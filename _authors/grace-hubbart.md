Grace Hubbart grew up in the church and as a pastor's daughter had an understanding of the Bible and a surface-level knowledge of what it meant to be a Christian.  It wasn't until she was well into her adult years that she had a real tangible encounter with Jesus.  From there she began to have a real relationship with her savior and began to see what she was created to do and the purpose of this life. Grace strongly believes in the importance of having an identity rooted in the word and the unfailing love that Jesus has for every single person. She believes strongly in walking out and using the Gifts of the Spirit daily. This is key to showing the Love of Jesus in order to impact as many people as possible with the truth of the Gospel. 

Grace currently serves as the Children's Director and heads up the Prophetic teams at River In the Hills church. She also has a strong desire to see in unity between the churches in Austin as a whole and serves on the leadership team for <a href="http://nowallsjustjesus.com">No Walls Just Jesus</a>.
